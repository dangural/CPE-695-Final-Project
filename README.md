### Abstract 

Due to the recent novel COVID-19 pandemic, there is a strong motivation to forecast or predict the number of confirmed cases for each geographic location. Forecasts based on statistical and mathematical models are imperative in finding the best interventions to limit the spread of the COVID-19 from human to human. This group studied the accuracy of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM constitute the best example of a successful learning of order dependence in sequence prediction problems. The group applied this model to not only COVID-19 but also Ebola, H1N1, MERS, and SARS pandemic and asked can  we  predict  how many  cases  of  each  virus  will  spread  within  a  respective country?
